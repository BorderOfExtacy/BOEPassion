# BORDEROFEXTACY_Passion

A refresh/rework of an adult Sims 3 mod.

If you just want to use the mod in your game, this page probably won't be interesting to you.

The mod's current major version download will be linked here once uploaded.


If you're interested in the mod's development, contribution, or just hanging around, [you can join the Discord server here.](https://discord.gg/y7YKWXcQGD)

## Description

Originally by Alfiechan and updated by Superstorm/Twilightstorm until 2021, BORDEROFEXTACY_Passion is a refresh/rework of where that work was left off.

In the spirit of collaboration and cooperation, it's an open-source project -- though it currently being worked on primarily by me (Xin).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Please see [this guide on ModTheSims](https://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Tutorial:Sims_3_Pure_Scripting_Modding) for a rundown on how to set up a script modding environment!

Up to date non-code mod contents (i.e. images, strings, etc) can usually be found in the .package of the latest [test release](https://github.com/BorderOfExtacy/BOEPassion/releases). Sims 3 Package Editor (S3PE) is required to edit this.

### Contributing

Any help is welcome! I'm far from a competent programmer, so anything is *really* appreciated.
[You can check the current issues for a collection of bugs and feature ideas if you're into that.](https://github.com/BorderOfExtacy/BOEPassion/issues)

### Body parts

Currently, sim body parts are hard-coded (i am not a comptent enough programmer to write an xml parser yet) and must be added directly.

If you have a bottom you'd like made compatible from the backend, see this guide [TBA] , and [create an issue ticket](https://github.com/BorderOfExtacy/BOEPassion/issues) with the needed information. Your mesh will not be included with the mod if you don't want it to be - the compat will still rely on the end user have your bottom as well as the mod itself.

## Help

If you need help with the mod, please direct it towards appropriate channels on the linked Discord above, or on the simblr.cc upload.

If you found a bug, you can also report it similarly, or submit a new issue via Github if you're familiar enough.

**TL;DR...**

You can modify it and redistribute your modifications/forks however you'd like, but they **cannot** be distributed for profit/under paywall (including early access paywall), and they must include this same license.


(Also, if you fork it and make your own build, it'd probably be a good idea to give it a different name, like [yourcreatorhandle]_passion - just to avoid confusion. You know how Sims people are.
